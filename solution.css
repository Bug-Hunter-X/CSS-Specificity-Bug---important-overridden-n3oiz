To solve this issue, you can adjust your CSS to either remove the `!important` declaration or increase the specificity of the selector using `!important`:

**Option 1: Remove `!important`**

The cleanest way is to avoid `!important` wherever possible. You can restructure your CSS to avoid conflicts:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

**Option 2: Increase Specificity with `!important` (Use cautiously)**

If you absolutely need the `!important` declaration, increase its specificity to ensure it overrides the other declaration:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green !important; /* Increased specificity */
}
```

Remember to use `!important` sparingly, as it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug in the long run.  Prioritizing well-structured CSS is generally preferred.
