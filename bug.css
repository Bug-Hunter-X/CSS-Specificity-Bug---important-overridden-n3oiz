The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the `.parent .child` selector has higher specificity than `.child`, overriding the `!important` declaration. This can be unexpected behavior if you intend for the `!important` declaration to always take precedence.
